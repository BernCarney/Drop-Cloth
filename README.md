# Drop Cloth

**Drop Cloth** is a boilerplate built with solid architecture, minimalism, and maintainability at its core. This is not meant as a framework, but more of a foundational starting point for projects. Every piece of **Drop Cloth** is developed organization and specificity in mind in the hopes of a lean and easily maintained finished product that can be customized and tailored to any project in the future.

## Project Goals

* Use a consistent workflow leveraging Git version control and semantic version naming (e.g. *`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`*).
* Follow ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS) methodologies as much as possible.
* Comment and document to explain how each piece of the project works
* Use clear and concise naming conventions throughout the project
  * Files
  * Classes
  * Variables (name-that-color)
  * Mixins and Functions
* Keep code minimal and clean
* Finish the project knowing more than at the start, and have lasting processes for future projects.
